Project Title: Analysis of Covid 19 Data
The aim of our project is to conduct spatial analysis of covid 19 pandemic in India using Spatial Geospatial data.Here we can create maps and illustrate the covid-19 spread in the area.By performing various regressions by taking the data like deaths,cured,confirmed cases.Analyze the role of non-numeric values and treating the values either by fillna or removing it.Developed predictive models to forecast future trends in death rates, cured conditions, and active cases.Models like Linear Regression, Multiple regression, pie chart,Correlation matrix and heat map,spatial clustering and spatial network. Data preprocessing is that we gather the spatial data including confirmed cases, cured, deaths and state/unionterritory. In our project data visualization plays a major role by pie charts, heat maps, spatial network among Indian states. For geospatial we have included the latitude and longitude for all the states.
